Library Management System - SQL Analysis

This project demonstrates a robust Library Management System using SQL for database design and operations. It includes features like book cataloging, user management, issue/return tracking, and report generation. The database structure is normalized for efficiency, supporting queries for analytics and smooth operations.

Key Features:

Books Table: Stores book details (ID, title, author, genre, etc.).

Users Table: Maintains user profiles (ID, name, contact, role).

Transactions Table: Tracks book issues, returns, and due dates.

Queries: Predefined SQL queries for analytics, such as overdue books, popular books, and user activity.

Normalization: Ensures minimal redundancy and data integrity.

This project is ideal for showcasing database design, query optimization, and SQL expertise. It can be extended for front-end integration or advanced analytics.
